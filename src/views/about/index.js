      <p>It was 2005. Laurie and David loved to have guests, loved wine, and loved competition...so they decided to combine them all! Sipper parties began and everyone loved it! Each year they learned how to improve the ease of hosting and despite many iterations of organizing, they decided an app was the best way to make this party easy for them...and easy for anyone to host.</p>
